## About

Results-driven Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience building web applications in SaaS, EdTech, FinTech, and Web3. I help companies accelerate development, optimize performance, and implement innovative solutions—reducing time-to-market by 30–50%.

At MetaLamp, I served as lead frontend developer on several projects, including a banking web app, an investment mobile application, and a DeFi solution for Telegram Mini Apps with TON payments. These products enabled clients to validate financial hypotheses and bring new fintech solutions to market faster.

At Flearn startup (EdTech), I led a small team and delivered an LMS MVP in 3 months—helping the company test its concept and attract early adopters.

I’m eager to join product teams in Web3, FinTech, or EdTech—especially those working with React/TypeScript and cutting-edge solutions.
