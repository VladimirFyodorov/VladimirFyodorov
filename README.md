# Hey! Nice to see you
I'm Vladimir, Web developer from Moscow, Russia, currently living in Belgrade, Serbia.

### About me
I have a bachelor's degree in economics from New Economic School and Higher School of Economics. During the last year of my program, I worked as a Data Analyst at [OZON](https://ozon.ru). After graduating in 2022, I changed my career path to Web Development.

### My projects
The best way to assess my skills is to see my projects:

1. My current project is the LMS platform [Flearn](https://flearn.net) ([GitHub](https://github.com/sulianova/flearn-frontend)) which i'm co-developing with [Sofi Ulianova](https://github.com/sulianova). We are using:

<img alt="React" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-45b8d8?style=flat-square&logo=react&logoColor=white" />
<img alt="Redux" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Redux-764ABC?style=flat-square&logo=redux&logoColor=white" />
with
<img alt="Firebase" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Firebase-EB844E?style=flat-square&logo=firebase&logoColor=white" />.
We are hoping to develop an LMS focused on courses for illustration and design.

2. To see my study process feel free to look at my [Study repository](https://github.com/VladimirFyodorov/Study).
It has tasks from **Terminal** to **DataStructures**, from **Layout to TypeScript**.

3. I'm also intrested in ML. My theses was **Forecasting Weather Derivatives Using LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks**. See: [Theses repo](https://github.com/VladimirFyodorov/Thesis)
