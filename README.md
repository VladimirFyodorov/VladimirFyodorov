## About

Results-driven Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience building web applications in SaaS, EdTech, FinTech and Web3. I help companies accelerate development, optimize performance, and implement innovative solutions—reducing time-to-market by 30-50%.

At MetaLamp, I developed a banking application for Telegram Mini Apps in 2 months, integrating TON cryptocurrency payments. At Flearn (EdTech), I optimized page load speed by 75%, boosting user retention. My data analytics background from Ozon enhances my problem-solving in tech-driven projects.

I'm eager to join product teams in Web3, FinTech, or EdTech—especially those working with React/TypeScript and cutting-edge solutions. Let's connect!
